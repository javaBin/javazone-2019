                        JavaZone started out in 2002 as a small conference for Java developers but has since then
                        evolved to become one of the largest developer conferences in the world. Each year thousands of
                        people gather in Oslo Spektrum for three full days of learning, mingling, and fun!

                        Last year, a record breaking 3100 people attended JavaZone. We were completely sold out of
                        tickets AND partner stands. The same happened last year, and a year before. So you might want to
                        join in early if you want to be part of the conference!

                    <p>
                        We want JavaZone‘s Expo Area to be an attractive space where our partners and participants can
                        hang out and spend time together. In previous years, our partners have done a great job helping
                        us achieve this goal, and we look forward to seeing what they bring to JavaZone 2019! JavaZone’s
                        Expo Area is a vibrant, busy space full of life and activity. As a partner you are not just
                        supporting our conference economically – you participate in the event and help creating a unique
                        atmosphere. We work closely with our partners to help them realize their ideas and make the most
                        out of their stands. Have you got a great concept for your JavaZone stand and need help to
                        realize it? Don’t be shy - just ask us. Almost anything is possible!

                        All our partner stands are traditionally located in the Expo Area, which is located in the
                        center of the venue. During each break, the Expo is full of attendees. This is partly because we
                        continuously serve food from the restaurant stands – throughout the day, and partly because of
                        you – our partners – make this area one of the liveliest Expo Areas of any conference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don‘t you believe us? Have a look for yourself! Our new partners are always surprised by the
                        huge attention their stands receive in the Expo Area. We have put together a short 15-second
                        timelapse from 2 hours of Expo time, showing both the flow of people during talks and in the
                        breaks between talks. Yes, you get exposure to that many people, for a total of 20 hours!
